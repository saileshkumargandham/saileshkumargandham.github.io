                    <strong>INTRODUCTION :-</strong><br>
					<p>Have you ever dreamt of flying your own fuel powered rocket which is simple, safe & exciting?
                                                  This we bring you the ideal platform for showcasing your understanding 
												  of fluid dynamics with the event<strong> HYDRO ROCKET</strong>. A rocket to shoot up into the sky to
							grab exciting cash prize in store. This tests the participants creativity in applying the effects of drag force on a dynamic domain & come up with clean, safe & novel design of rockets powered by simple fuels such as water (H2O). Balance between speed 
												  and control is just what is desired to design the Neolithic  multi-stage propulsion.
					</p>     
                
				 
				  
				  
								<strong>ABOUT:-</strong>  <br>
					
								It is the event where you have the chance to show case your rocketry skills.
								Experience the fun in true engineering while working with rocket propulsion and aerodynamic.
								One of the most fun events, it will surely leave you missing it once it's over.
								The purpose of here is to design and manufacture a water rocket . A water rocket is a type 
								of model rocket using water as its reaction mass. The pressure vessel- the engine of the rocket 
								is usually a used plastic soft drink bottle. The water is forced out by a pressurized gas,
								typically compressed air. It is an example of Newton's third law of motion.
									It covers various aspects of product making including design, model constructions.



																	<br>


										<strong>ROUNDS INVOLVED:-</strong>  <br>
											1.	Range covered.<br>
									2.	Time of flight.<br>

										<strong>ROUND 1 </strong><br>
											&nbsp
										The main objective of this round is to launch a water-rocket without any payload, and make it go as far as possible from the launch point i.e. the maximum horizontal distance. The horizontal distance will be considered from the starting point to the point where any part of the rocket first touches the ground.
											Multi-stage rockets are also allowed but the combined tank capacity must be 2 liters only. Each team shall be allowed three attempts to launch and the better of the three will be considered. (This may be altered later based on the performance of the teams).
													<br>
										<strong>NOTE:-</strong>
										<br>   Pressure limit for this round will be 60 psi. Only 30 percent of the candidates appearing in first round will be qualifying into  the second round which depends upon the score they get.
											<br>
											<strong>ROUND 2</strong><br><br>

											This round the teams whose rocket will remain in air for maximum time will get maximum point. The participant can fill up to any pressure and release his rocket. The time of flight is calculated. The more is the time of flight more will be the points he scores. Only two attempts will be given to each participants in this round.
																<br>
											<strong>RULES AND REGULATIONS:-</strong>  <br>       
											A team may consists of a maximum of 2 members. Team may be different rockets of different rounds.
												The rocket may be built completely scratch and not using model rocketry parts. 
											The pressure vessel must be made from commercially available non metallic soda bottles (PET bottles). Fins if required are to be constructed from lightweight non metallic materials.
											The rocket must use tap water as its primary reaction mass. Thrust must come from expelling reaction mass/water, not from air discharge.
														Participants will be provided with tap water. The angle at which the rocket is to be launched can be decided by the participant.
												The organizer will not provide a launcher, so team must bring their own launcher.
											The rocket must use compressed air as its energy source. A normal bicycle pumps well as a foot pump will be provided to compressed air. The size of the pump outlet will be the standard type available in the market. If your design has a different nozzle size, please be sure to bring your own nozzle and connected pipe.
													All parts if the rocket should be properly attached to the a main body .If any parts (fins etc.) breaks away during flight, it will comprise the safety of the spectators. Therefore, such water rockets may be disqualified from further participation at the discretion of the organizers. Each team is strongly advised to bring two rockets of the same design (the second acting as a backup) in case of any damage. The organizers will not be responsible for any damage suffered by rockets during the competition. Extra time shall not be given for remaking of damaged rockets.

												<br>
												<strong>JUDGEMENT CRITERIA:-</strong>
														<br>
												The final Judgement is based on the total points scored by the participated team in all the two rounds described above
													The points are also given to the teams based on their creativity and simplicity in making the water propelled rockets, this will be the decided at the time of the event by the event manager by viewing their rocket samples.
														The total points scored in all the three rounds are added up and awarded as their final score.

The main objective of this event is to build a strong, light and aesthetically design bridge with Popsicle sticks.
<br>
<strong>GUIDE LINES:-</strong><br>
       1. Form a team of two members. It costs 300/- per team.
       <br>2. Only wooden Popsicle sticks (10 cm height,8 Cm width) and water based glue such as Elmers may be used to make your bridge. You can cut and shape them anyway.The length of the Bridge structure must be 60cm.
      <br>3.A car must be able to roll from one end to other. In other words, your bridge must actually be a bridge.
     <br> 4. Please remember that the load testing may results in the destruction of bridge. We don't know what the maximum load your bridge can hold until it breaks. Decoration and paintings are allowed, but the judge will decide if any additions (other than those made from pop sticks) result in an unfair advantage to a bridge entered for load testing.
     <br> 5. The bridge must accept the test load block in the centre of the span on the road bed surface, must be able to receive the test load from testing   apparatus. If this is not possible for reasons related to the design of the bridge, test load block may place any top of the trusses, beams, supports or roof structures.
     <br>6. A bridge will be considered to have failed under the test load if the bridge member breaks, fractures, cracks separates from any attachment or joint, resulting in the collapse of bridge.
       <br> 
<strong>JUDGEMENT CRITERIA:-</strong><br>
       Considering two aspects:<br>
<strong>1) EFFECIENCY: </strong><br> Ratio of ultimate load bridge to bridge weight.
<br><strong>2) AESTHETIC DESIGN:</strong><br> Bridge should be flat and with uneven surface inside it and its design should be good.
<br>
<strong>Registration fee:-</strong><br>
300/- for a Team of 2 members or 200/- per head

				This event is truly an epic experience for CAD drafter's and designers. Computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) software
replaces manual drafting with greater speed and accuracy. Cad manic is an event to evaluate the drafting, modelling 
skills of the students in part modelling to design and analysis.<br>
It's time to fire up your imagination and creativity, so Aiming to test imagination of designers.
This <strong>CAD MANIC</strong> is about testing the brilliance of solid modelling and detailing a structure in 
AutoCAD (3D). <br>Now the clash has began so boot up your modelling intelligences and shine your
